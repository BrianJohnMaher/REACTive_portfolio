Below are screenshots of my portfolio, that I am unfortunately not finished working on. However I needed to create a submission in order to graduate bootcamp. 
I am very sorry, and rather embarrassed, that I'm not be able to provide a proper link. However, the work that I have put into the figma-file, should hopefully display my full intentions. 
I assure you that I will provide the link to it deployed, as soon as I am able to.
